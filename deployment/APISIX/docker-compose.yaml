## instead of using local storage for local learning (see line above)
## you can also configure central nfs storage by configuring nfs volume (uncomment the relevant section at end of this file)
## use a shared nfs storage which is recommended in redundant deployments (uncomment line below, comment out the line above) 
#     - learning_nfs:/db:z

## example juice-shop backend container (vulnerable webserver, USE ONLY FOR TESTING AND IN LAB ENV)
##
## uncomment this block for testing purposes only, make sure to also adjust the apisix.yaml file in {APISIX_CONFIG} folder
## to include route and node configuration for forwarding external traffic to the juiceshop-backend container
## (apisix listens by default for HTTP/HTTPS on port 9080/9443) 
## you can use the example file available here:
## https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openappsec/openappsec/refs/heads/main/examples/juiceshop/apisix.yaml
## in the appsec-apisix service definition
## note that juiceshop container listens on HTTP port 3000 by default
#
# juiceshop-backend:
#   image: bkimminich/juice-shop:latest
#   container_name: juiceshop-backend


## advanced configuration: learning_nfs volume for nfs storage in shared_storage container
##
## when configuring nfs storage in shared_storage container configuration above, make sure to also specify learning_nfs volume (see example below for using AWS EFS storage)
##
#volumes:
# learning_nfs:
#   driver: local
#   driver_opts:
#     type: nfs
#     o: addr=fs-abcdef.efs.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com,rw,nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport
#     device: ":/"
